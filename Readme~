PROJECT TITLE 
	Implementation of Naive Bayes with Laplace Smoothing

NAME
    naive_bayes_classifier : A python program to make a naive bayes classifier
    with laplace smoothing.

SYNOPSIS
    python naive_bayes_laplace.py 

DESCRIPTION
     This program implements a Naive Bayes in python language.
	 There are four feauteres in the given training set. They 
     are mutually exclusive. We map a frequency table and 
     compute their probabilities with laplace smoothing taking
     alpha as 1. 
     This look up table is used to compute the conditional 
     probability using bayes rule. 
     A test data set is used, where the feature inputs are 
     given and we determine the class(Play / NotPlay).
	 
LIBRARIES 
	Pandas is used extensively for the assignment.
	Numpy is also used.  
     

FILES
     naive_bayes_laplace.py
	 The file contains the driver code for the program.
	 
	 Q2-tennis.csv
	 File contains the train dataset in csv format.

          

EXAMPLES

     python naive_bayes_laplace.py
	
	Used test data set to generate results,
    outputing class - 'Play/No Play'
